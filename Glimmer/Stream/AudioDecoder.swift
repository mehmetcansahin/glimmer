    // MARK: - P1 AUDIO playout CUSHION (the under-run fix)
    //
    // Root cause of the under-run cluster: there was NO playout cushion.
    // Each 5ms opus packet was decoded and immediately `play()`ed, so the
    // scheduled-ahead depth sat at ~0-5ms - ON the under-run floor. Any momentary
    // slip (host-vs-Mac clock drift on a ~5s cadence; per-event scheduling jitter
    // under peak high-bitrate video load - NOT CPU saturation) drained it to empty → an
    // audible gap. 0 over-runs / only-ever-drains was the tell.
    //
    // The fix holds a small playout cushion BEFORE starting playback, then lets it
    // run gapless: defer `play()` until a target of decoded audio is queued
    // (a PRE-ROLL), so drift + jitter drain into headroom instead of into a
    // gap. This is audio-only - the latency-critical video path is untouched - and
    // the cushion (~30ms up to the link-aware cap: 150ms wired / 300ms tunnel) is
    // within the non-critical audio budget and under the over-run ceiling (cap+40ms),
    // so audio cannot drift seconds behind. The cushion
    // ADAPTS like the video pacer's jitter buffer: it starts at the base target and
    // grows one step per measured under-run (a full drain; at most one per 10s, none
    // after a gap longer than the cap), so a link whose delivery gaps outpace the
    // base cushion deepens itself instead of glitching repeatedly.
    // It only grows on real evidence (an under-run), never blanket-deep - and it
    // DECAYS one step per sustained under-run-free window, so depth is a temporary,
    // evidence-keyed state that recovers toward the base, never a permanent pin.
    //
    // The paused pre-roll exists at COLD START only. After a mid-stream drain the
    // node keeps playing - the scheduleBuffer completion path deliberately makes
    // ZERO AV-node calls (it runs unserialized against `shutdown()`; every AV call
    // lives on paths the state lock or the meter-lock-then-call discipline covers)
    // - and the cushion rebuilds via whichever of TWO paths the link offers:
    //   (1) the post-gap CATCH-UP CLUMP - a jittery link delivers the gap's
    //       packets in a burst, and the 250ms gate grace shields that clump from
    //       the trim and the ceiling so it can stack back up to target; or
    //   (2) the grace-expiry SILENCE BACKFILL - on a STEADY link (host-side audio
    //       outage, playback-side drain) packets resume at exactly real-time rate,
    //       no clump ever forms, and standing fill would pin at ~0 while the
    //       target ratchet climbed uselessly (the under-run cascade). When the
    //       grace expires with fill still a step short of
    //       target, the decode path schedules ONE zeroed buffer of (target − fill)
    //       ms so the cushion reaches target immediately (`backfillCushion`): one
    //       deliberate, bounded quiet stretch right behind an already-audible gap
    //       buys the headroom that ends the cascade.
    // The re-prime is a state-machine re-arm, not a wall-time pause.
    //
    // The cap, though, governs only PRE-ROLL - so once steady-state backlog grew (an
    // early under-run deepening the cushion, or receive briefly outrunning playout) it
    // had no trim/decay and PINNED deep (~235ms measured = ~235ms pure A/V lag). The
    // companion fix is a steady-state TRIM-TOWARD-TARGET on the schedule path
    // (`meterRegisterScheduleOrOverrun`): once primed, packets that would hold the
    // backlog a hysteresis band past the cushion target are dropped - rate-limited,
    // and standing down briefly after a re-prime so the post-gap catch-up clump
    // (the cushion rebuild itself) isn't chopped - walking the queue back DOWN to
    // the target. Net: backlog rests near the target (~30ms typical on a clean
    // link; deeper only while gaps recur, decaying back once they stop).
