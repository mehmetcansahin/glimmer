# signing-creds.sh - sole reader/writer of the Glimmer signing credentials file.
#
# The release pipeline (make codesign-setup / setup-notary / dist / dev) must be
# non-interactive from ANY session - SSH, cron, a CI runner - which rules out
# both 1Password (`op read` wants an interactive/biometric signin) and the login
# keychain (locked outside GUI sessions; and signing flows that touch the login
# keychain are the known re-prompt trap). So every signing secret lives in ONE
# plain KEY=value file OUTSIDE the repo, protected the same way ~/.ssh keys are:
# owned by the caller, mode 0600/0400. This script refuses anything looser, and
# every Makefile consumer goes through it so the policy has a single home.
#
# Default path: ~/.config/developer-id/signing.env
# Override:     GLIMMER_SIGNING_CREDS env var (the Makefile exports it from its
#               SIGNING_CREDS variable, so `make dist SIGNING_CREDS=...` works).
#
# Subcommands:
#   path                  Print the resolved credentials-file path.
#   check                 Validate existence + ownership + permissions.
#   get KEY [--optional]  Print KEY's value. A missing key is an error unless
#                         --optional (then prints nothing, exits 0).
#   set KEY VALUE         Create or update KEY (creates the file 0600 if absent,
#                         never loosens an existing one). Atomic rewrite.
#   init                  Write a commented template (refuses to overwrite).
#
# File format: one KEY=VALUE per line; the value is everything after the FIRST
# '=' - no quoting, no expansion, quotes would become part of the value. Lines
# starting with '#' are comments. The file is parsed, never sourced, so values
# cannot execute anything.
#
# Keys the Makefile consumes (none are read anywhere else):
#   SIGN_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD  password of the dedicated release-signing keychain
#                           (auto-generated + stored by `make codesign-setup`)
#   P12_PATH                absolute path to the Developer ID .p12 export
#   P12_PASSWORD            passphrase of that .p12
#   NOTARY_KEY_PATH         absolute path to the App Store Connect API key (.p8)
#   NOTARY_KEY_ID           that key's ID
#   NOTARY_ISSUER_ID        the team's issuer ID
