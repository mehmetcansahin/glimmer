# EVERYTHING BUT PUBLISH (the dev tier - notarized Release, installed, NOT
# published). Every build here is byte-for-byte what ships - same Developer-ID
# signing, notarization, and STRICT library validation - so there's no
# adhoc/Debug divergence to chase:
#   make                   Build (Release: Dev-ID + notarized) + install to
#                          /Applications. Falls back to adhoc Release w/o a cert.
#   make dev               Run tests, then build + install + relaunch. Inner loop.
#   make reinstall         Build + install + quit-and-relaunch (no tests).
#   make install           Build + install, no relaunch (same as bare `make`).
#   make open              Build + install + open.
#   make release           Build the notarized Release app only (no install).
#   make app               Quick compile-only check (no signing / notarize).
#   make test              Build + run the GlimmerTests unit-test bundle.
#   make uninstall         Remove Glimmer.app.
#   make clean             Remove build outputs.
#
# RELEASE (one published, auto-updatable build - everything flows here):
#   make release-publish   THE release. dist → ZIP + EdDSA-sign → GitHub release +
#                          appcast; existing installs auto-update (Sparkle).
#   make dist              Build-only checkpoint: Release → Developer ID sign →
#                          notarize → staple → DMG (no publish). This is
#                          release-publish's first step; run it alone only to
#                          inspect a DMG before publishing.
#
# ONE-TIME SETUP (signing / notarization / update keys):
#   make creds-init        Write the signing credentials file template.
#   make codesign-setup    Build the signing keychain + import the Developer ID.
#   make setup-notary      Store the notarytool profile.
#   make sparkle-keys      Generate the Sparkle EdDSA update-signing keypair.
#
# PROFILING / TELEMETRY:
#   make profile           Instruments → Time Profiler (CPU).
#   make profile-signposts Instruments → Logging (OSSignposts).
#   make enable-telem      Turn the app's opt-in telemetry exporter on.
#   make disable-telem     Turn the app's opt-in telemetry exporter off.

# --- Code-signing keychain (CI-grade, non-interactive) ---------------------

# One-time setup: build a DEDICATED signing keychain containing the Developer ID
# identity, imported from the .p12 with `-T /usr/bin/codesign` so codesign gets
# non-interactive access (no "codesign wants to use key" prompt). This is the
# standard CI/CD pattern and is the ONLY reliable fix - the GUI "Allow all" and
# a bare `set-key-partition-list` don't stick on a key that was imported into
# the login keychain without codesign in its ACL.
#
# Non-destructive: creates a separate keychain, never touches the login
# keychain or any existing identity. The .p12 path + passphrase come from the
# credentials file (P12_PATH / P12_PASSWORD - see `make creds-init`). The
# keychain password is read from the credentials file too, or generated in-
# process on first run and stored back there (NEVER the login keychain, which
# is locked in non-GUI sessions), so `make ensure-signing` can re-unlock the
# keychain after a sleep/lock from any session. The keychain is left UNLOCKED
# so codesign can use it immediately; `make codesign-teardown` removes it.
#
# After this, `make sign` / `make dist` find the identity via DEVELOPER_ID

# with a date-stamped name; double-click in Finder to open in Instruments.

# overflow checks + `-Onone` so they're not representative:
#
#   make release && make profile
#
# Time limit is 60s for Time Profiler (long enough for a full stream startup
# + a minute of gameplay), 120s for the Logging template (signposts need more
# wall-clock to accumulate meaningful per-frame samples at 60Hz).
