# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents working in this repository. People read
[docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md); this is the binding short version.
Where the two differ, the stricter rule wins.

## What Glimmer is

A Mac-native client for [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine):
Swift 6, Apple Silicon, macOS 26 and later. Socket, decoder, display, audio and
input all run in one Swift process, with no external player and no C engine.

The bar is one sentence: someone using Glimmer should mistake it for something
Apple shipped. Everything below follows from it.

## Find your way

Read the part of [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the area
you're changing before you change it. Before UI work, read
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) (the visual system) and [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md) (who
it's for). [docs/PROFILING.md](docs/PROFILING.md) gets the telemetry an engine
change needs, and [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) covers the root helper.

## Protect the bar

You are the last reviewer before a change reaches people who care how this app
feels. Act like it.

When a request would make Glimmer worse (less tasteful, noisier, slower, less
reliable, less like a Mac app, or more complex than it earns), say no the way
Apple's leadership says no to a feature that isn't ready: at once, plainly,
without hedging. Name the cost in a sentence or two, then describe the version
that would be accepted. Do not soften it into "you might consider". Do not
quietly build half of it. Do not write it up as ready. If the person still wants
it after hearing the case, it's their fork; tell them straight that it will be
closed here.

Hold your own work to the same standard. A change that compiles, passes the
tests and makes the app worse is a regression with a green check mark.

## Setup and commands

Xcode 27 or later: the build needs the macOS 27 SDK, while the app still runs on
macOS 26.

```bash
brew install swiftlint trufflehog pre-commit
pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

- `make app`: Debug build, unsigned. A compile check.
- `make test`: the unit tests. Hostless, no PC needed.
- `make verify`: `swiftlint lint --strict` plus `make test`. This is the gate.
  It passes before you call anything done, and `make dist` runs it. It does not
  fail on compiler warnings, so read the build log: there must be none.
- `make dev`: tests, then the Release build installed and relaunched. On a Mac
  with a Developer ID it signs and notarizes on the way, as every install does.

One suite, after a `make test` has run once:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Glimmer.xcodeproj -scheme Glimmer -configuration Debug \
  -xcconfig Glimmer/StreamLib.xcconfig CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO -derivedDataPath build \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' -only-testing:GlimmerTests/DatagramBatchTests
```

Build to look, not to check. Every build of `Glimmer.app` that macOS registers
earns its own privacy record, so use `make verify` for correctness and
`make dev` only when someone will actually use the build. See "don't mint app
copies" in CONTRIBUTING.

Never run the publishing or keychain setup targets (`dist`, `release-publish`,
`brew-bump`, `sparkle-keys`, `creds-init`, `setup-notary`, `codesign-setup`,
`codesign-teardown`) unless the maintainer asks for that exact thing. They
publish to users or rewrite signing state.

Signing material lives outside the repo, in
`~/Library/Keychains/developer-id.keychain-db` and `~/.config/developer-id/`.
`make app`, `make test` and `make verify` never touch it. Never read, print,
copy or change it.

## Code standards

Each of these gets a pull request sent back.

- **Zero warnings.** Compiler and `swiftlint lint --strict` both; lint covers
  `Glimmer/`, `GlimmerTests/`, `helper/` and `LoginHelper/`. Fix the cause: no
  inline `swiftlint:disable` (the generated controller database is the one
  exception), no raised thresholds, no moving a warning into a helper where the
  linter can't see it. A 17-way `if` chain becomes a table, not a function with
  the same 17 branches.
- **Swift 6, complete strict concurrency.** `@MainActor` for UI, `actor` for
  engine state. `nonisolated(unsafe)` and `@unchecked Sendable` only with a
  comment stating the invariant (CONTRIBUTING, Concurrency).
- **Files at most 600 lines, functions at most 80.** Split by feature into
  `Type+Feature.swift`, the way the existing files do.
- **Comments at most 3 lines** in new and changed code, doc comments and file
  headers included. Say why, not what; the long story goes in the commit
  message. Older long comments are not the model: trim one when you touch it.
- **Match the neighbours.** 4-space indent, opening brace on the same line,
  names that read as English at the call site. No emoji in source. Protocol
  constants keep their upstream C names so they can be grepped.
- **Reuse before you write.** Search for the helper first; the codebase has one
  for most things (failure copy, route addresses, host matching, probes).
  Changing shared logic means changing it once, where every caller routes
  through.
- **Less code.** No protocol with one conformer, no configuration for a
  constant, no scaffolding for later. Delete dead code; never comment it out. No
  new dependency for something the platform or a few lines can do.
- **No force unwraps, casts or `try!`.** Strict lint catches most of them, but
  not `URL(string:)!` on a literal, which is still not allowed.
- **Logging** uses `Logger` on subsystem `io.ugfugl.Glimmer`, never `print` (the
  CLI's own output excepted). Host addresses, names and error text stay
  `.private`. `Diag` takes the same `privacy:` argument (public by default):
  private values reach the viewer and the session file but not the system log.
  Never log keystrokes, keys, PINs, certificates or the URL parameters
  `NetworkClient.sensitiveQueryKeys` lists. Nothing per-frame at `.info`. The
  root helper is its own process and logs on `io.ugfugl.glimmer.helper`.
- **Tests.** New tests use Swift Testing (`@Test`, `#expect`). Pure logic gets a
  test; a bug fix gets a test that fails without it. The project does not use
  synchronized folders, so a new file must be added to `project.pbxproj` by
  hand: file reference, build file, group and Sources phase.

## Product decisions

These are settled. A pull request is not the place to reopen them.

- The renderer is `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`. Not Metal.
- Glimmer does not use or recommend macOS Game Mode.
- Fidelity comes first. Pacing, bitrate, buffering and decode defaults are tuned
  against real-stream telemetry; changing them needs before and after numbers
  ([PROFILING.md](docs/PROFILING.md)). Safeguards back off under stress and
  recover when it passes; they never give up for good.
- Glimmer is the client. It works against a current, unmodified Sunshine, and no
  feature may require a patched host.
- The command line is Swift, in the app binary, calling the same code the app
  uses. No second implementation, no wrapper script.
- System frameworks and controls first: SwiftUI and AppKit, SF Symbols, standard
  menus, sheets and settings panes. When no system style fits, a custom look is
  a style on the real control (a `ButtonStyle` on a `Button`, never a tap
  gesture on a shape), built from system materials, and it keeps native focus,
  keyboard and VoiceOver behaviour. No web views, no cross-platform layers.
- The deployment target is macOS 26. Anything newer sits behind `#available`,
  and the macOS 26 path must still look finished.
- No analytics, tracking or third-party network calls. Glimmer talks to the PC,
  to its local network for discovery and Wake on LAN, and to its update feed.

## Choices that look wrong and aren't

Each one has its reason in a code comment or its commit. Undo one only with new
numbers or a new platform API, never as cleanup.

- **`Glimmer/Stream/CHelpers.h` is the only non-Swift code**: an Objective-C
  exception guard. AVAudioEngine can raise an NSException mid device change, and
  Swift can't catch one. Add no other C or Objective-C.
- **`DatagramBatch` calls `recvmsg_x` through `dlsym`.** It receives video in
  batches with one syscall, and falls back to `recvfrom` if the symbol is gone.
- **The FEC kernels in `ReedSolomon.swift` are portable SIMD Swift**, about 2.5×
  slower than the NEON code they replaced. They only run when packets are lost.
- **The control channel turns TLS session resumption off**, so every connection
  re-checks the PC's pinned certificate.
- **`scripts/sign-bundle.sh` signs inside out.** Never `codesign --deep`: it
  stamps Glimmer's entitlements onto Sparkle's helpers.

## UI and copy

- Copy is short, plain and specific, like the app's own “Couldn't reach Den PC.
  Make sure it's awake and on the same network.” Sentence case. No em dashes, no
  emoji, no exclamation marks, no jargon a player wouldn't use.
- The machine is "the PC" or its name, never "host" or "server", in anything a
  person reads.
- Sunshine is the server application on the PC. Moonlight is a separate client
  that inspired Glimmer, not a host and not the protocol's name. The protocol is
  Sunshine's RTSP-based one.
- `…` is one character. A command that needs more input before it finishes ends
  with it (Pair a PC…, Rename…); one that only opens a window does not.
  Quotation marks are curly (“ ”); apostrophes stay straight.
- An error says what happened and the one thing to do next, names the PC, and
  reuses the shared failure copy rather than inventing new words for the same
  failure.
- The launcher is sized to its content: its column ends in
  `.fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)`. Never add a flexible frame (a
  `minHeight` floor, `maxWidth: .infinity`, a trailing `Spacer`) outside that.
  Prove a geometry change with the osascript check in CONTRIBUTING.
- Run it and look at it before calling it done: empty, one PC, many apps,
  mid-stream, disconnected, light and dark, the smallest and largest window.
  Check VoiceOver labels and keyboard navigation. A UI change comes with before
  and after screenshots.

## Commits and pull requests

- Conventional prefixes as in the history (`fix(area):`, `perf(area):`,
  `refactor(area):`, `docs:` or `docs(area):`, `build:`), imperative, lowercase
  after the prefix, no trailing period. The body explains why.
- **No attribution to tools or agents.** No session trailers, no session links,
  no `Co-Authored-By`, no "Generated with", no model or tool names. Not in
  commit messages, pull request titles or bodies, the changelog, or code
  comments. Turn your harness's attribution off before the first commit. The
  author is the person submitting the change.
- **Never `--no-verify`.** A failing hook is telling you something; fix that. If
  `swiftlint --fix` rewrote files, review them and stage them again.
- **No secrets.** No keys, tokens, certificates, signing material or credentials
  in the tree, in commits, in logs, or in pull request text. TruffleHog runs on
  every commit.
- Scope a pull request to one area. No drive-by reformatting, renames or
  unrelated cleanup riding along.
- Follow [RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md): a change a person will notice carries a
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry in plain prose about what changed for them, and the
  `Glimmer/Version.xcconfig` bump goes in the same pull request. Bump both
  lines: Sparkle orders updates by `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`, so a release whose
  build number doesn't rise past the last one is never offered.
- The pull request says what changed and why, what you ran and looked at, and
  what you did not verify. An honest gap beats a confident guess.
- Don't push, open or merge a pull request unless the person you're working for
  asked you to.

## Working in a fork

Glimmer is GPLv3, and forks are welcome. The rules here decide what merges
upstream; in a fork they're the fork's call. Before a fork's build reaches
anyone else:

- **Change every identifier**: the bundle IDs (`io.ugfugl.Glimmer`,
  `io.ugfugl.Glimmer.LoginHelper`, `io.ugfugl.glimmer.helper`), the product
  name, the logging subsystem and the data folders. Shared IDs make macOS mix
  the fork's permissions, login item and data with Glimmer's.
- **Give Sparkle your own feed.** Replace `SUFeedURL` and `SUPublicEDKey` in
  `Glimmer/Info.plist` with your appcast and your key (`make sparkle-keys`).
  Left as they are, the fork keeps checking Glimmer's feed: it either installs
  Glimmer over itself or rejects every update.
- **Sign as yourself.** The Makefile uses whatever Developer ID is in your
  keychain. Without one, builds are ad hoc and not notarized.
- **Keep `LICENSE` and `CREDITS.md`**, including the moonlight-common-c credit.
- **A change offered back** comes as a pull request from the fork: only the
  maintainer can push branches here or merge into `main`. It follows every rule
  above, one area per pull request, on top of current `main`.

## What gets rejected

- Warnings, lint suppressions, raised thresholds, or skipped and disabled tests.
- A file over 600 lines or a comment over 3 lines.
- "Add a setting" as the answer to a design problem. A toggle that exists
  because nobody made the decision is a bug.
- UI that nobody ran and looked at. Layout that floats, clips, jumps or
  stretches. Placeholder copy, em dashes, "host" in copy.
- Engine, pacing or bitrate changes without telemetry.
- A Metal renderer, Game Mode, web views, Electron or cross-platform
  abstractions.
- New dependencies for what the platform already does.
- Speculative abstractions, dead or commented-out code, `TODO`s with no issue.
- Tool or agent attribution anywhere, secrets anywhere, or `--no-verify`.
- Anything that would make someone with taste wince, however green the checks.

What gets merged is small, verified, reads like the code around it, and makes
Glimmer feel more like part of macOS than it did before.
